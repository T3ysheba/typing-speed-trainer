Typing Speed Trainer is a web-based application designed to help users improve their typing speed and accuracy. The application measures your Words Per Minute (WPM) and accuracy by allowing you to type out randomly generated text within a specified time frame. 

### Technologies used

React: Frontend library used for building the user interface.
